# vfiogpu-voidlinux-ressources
Scripts and tools to drive a voidlinux system with Qemu/KVM guest GPU passthrough.
These tools and scripts will allow you to use a bare metal GPU inside a Windows, Linux or macOS VM.

## installing and setting up virt-manager
this guide follows the instruction method using the gui virt-manager package
> minimal solution with only qemu & libvirt in progress
```
# xbps-install -S virtmanager libvirt qemu
```
create symlinks for libvirt deamons in the services directory
```
# ln -s /etc/sv/virtlockd /var/service
# ln -s /etc/sv/virtlogd /var/service
# ln -s /etc/sv/libvirtd /var/service
```
either reboot the system or run `# sv up <deamon>` for every deamon (ie. virtlockd)

setting up vfio gpu drivers is the next step before creating the vm

## setting up vfio pci ids
run `./scripts/iommu.sh` on the host system to display devices with IOMMU groups and their respective pci.ids
```
$ bash ./iommu.sh
[...]
IOMMU Group 22 04:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation GP107 [GeForce GTX 1050 Ti] [10de:1c82] (rev a1)
IOMMU Group 22 04:00.1 Audio device [0403]: NVIDIA Corporation GP107GL High Definition Audio Controller [10de:0fb9] (rev a1)
IOMMU Group 23 ...
[...]
```
> All the devices in the IOMMU group 22 of my target GPU need to be bound to the vfio driver during boot.
>
Take note of the pci.ids at the end of the lines of all devices in the target's IOMMU group, here:
`[10de:1c82]` & `[10de:0fb9]`
## include those devices into the vfio-pci.ids kernel parameter
edit the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=` line in `/etc/default/grub` by adding `vfio-pci.ids=<ID>,<ID2>` for example:
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="vfio-pci.ids=10de:1c82,10de:0fb9 loglevel=4"
```
don't forget to update grub
```
# update-grub
```

## ensuring the vfio driver is loaded early at boot
modify `/etc/dracut.conf.d/20-vfio.conf` with a text editor:
```
force_drivers+=" vfio_pci vfio vfio_iommu_type1 "
```
regenerate the initramfs using dracut:
```
# dracut -f
```
or run 
```
# xbps-reconfigure linux<x.x>
```
(replace <x.x> with version number ie : 6.6)

## reboot your device to ensure that the GPU is bound to the VFIO drivers
```
# lspci -k | grep -A 2 'NVIDIA'
```
> replace 'NVIDIA' with 'AMD' or your GPU manufacturer.
> 
Expected output :
```
04:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GP107 [GeForce GTX 1050 Ti] (rev a1)
        Subsystem: PNY Device 11bf
        Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci
--
04:00.1 Audio device: NVIDIA Corporation GP107GL High Definition Audio Controller (rev a1)
        Subsystem: PNY Device 11bf
        Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci
--
```
> note that both devices `04:00.0` and `04:00.1` need to be bound to the VFIO driver, as well as any other device in the same IOMMU group as the target GPU when using iommu.sh
## (optional) create a custom grub entry to boot w/o the VFIO driver
This allows you to fully use the normally passedthrough GPU on the host OS
>note that these instructions can be reversed in order to boot normally without the vfio drivers and only passthrough the GPU when booting a custom grub entry
>
`[work in progress]`
